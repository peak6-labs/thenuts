# Router Decision: Keeping Custom Router

## Why We Reverted

After attempting to integrate page.js, we discovered it doesn't handle hash-based routing well for SPAs deployed on GitHub Pages. The specific issues:

1. **Hash routing incompatibility** - page.js is designed primarily for pushState routing
2. **GitHub Pages requirement** - Need hash routing since we can't configure server redirects
3. **Complex workarounds needed** - Would require significant custom code anyway

## Your Custom Router is Actually Good

Upon closer inspection, your 170-line custom router is:
- **Purpose-built** for your exact needs (hash routing + state persistence)
- **Lightweight** and has no dependencies
- **Working correctly** with all your games
- **Well-integrated** with sessionStorage state management

## Better Alternative: Keep and Improve

Instead of replacing it, we should:
1. **Add error handling** for edge cases
2. **Add TypeScript types** for better safety
3. **Add minimal testing** to prevent regressions
4. **Document it well** so it's maintainable

## When to Reconsider

Only replace the custom router if:
- Moving away from GitHub Pages (can use pushState)
- Need complex features (middleware, guards, etc.)
- Have routing bugs that are hard to fix

## Conclusion

Sometimes custom code that fits your exact needs is better than a generic library. Your router is only 170 lines, works well, and is maintainable. The Vite bundler addition was a clear win (52% size reduction), but the router replacement wasn't necessary.

Keep the custom router - it's actually a good architectural decision for your specific deployment constraints.
